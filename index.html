		<p>My name is James and I am a new student who enrolled this school to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript involved in creating websites.  
			At first, I did not know anything about coding; however, HTML is very simple and is designed specifically to mark web pages. 
			I used HTML as a guide so I can figure out how to display text and other page elements.    
			The reason is because many people want to create their own webpages, so I need to require knowledge of understanding HTML codes in general.
			Perceiving and displaying the codes is the main key to format the text and change the html of the page.  
			The more I learn from coding, the better developer I will become.</p>
